### Hi there 👋
I’m currently studying full stack web development and it's quite a challenge, but it's amazing to see the huge online community helping each other out. 
So far I've learned `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`,`Node.js`, `Express`, and `MongoDB`.

I enjoy beaches, rainforest, yoga and can't wait to travel again soon.
