### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m currently studying full stack web development and it's quite a challenge, but it's amazing to see the huge online community helping each other out. 
So far I've learned to work with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `PostgreSQL`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `React` and `React Native`.

I enjoy beaches, rainforest, yoga and can't wait to travel again soon.
