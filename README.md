### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I recently received my full stack web development certificate and I am looking forward to continously learn more about the field. It's amazing to see the huge online community helping each other out. 
So far I've learned to work with `HTML`, `CSS`, `JavaScript`, `PostgreSQL`, `Node.js`, `Express`, `MongoDB`, `React`, `React Native`, `Angular`and `TypeScript`.

I enjoy beaches, rainforest, yoga and can't wait to travel again soon.
